          <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein was more than a physicist—he was a curious soul who reshaped how we see the universe. Born in Germany in 1879, he challenged conventional thinking with ideas that bent time and space, like his theory of relativity and the iconic equation 
                𝐸=𝑚𝑐2
                . But beyond the chalkboard, Einstein was a deep thinker, a refugee from Nazi Germany, and a passionate advocate for peace and civil rights. He spent his later years in Princeton, still chasing the mysteries of the cosmos with childlike wonder. His legacy isn’t just scientific—it’s a reminder that imagination, humility, and courage can change the world.</p>
